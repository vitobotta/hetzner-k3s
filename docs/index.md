<h3 align="center">The easiest and fastest way to create<br/>production-ready Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner Cloud</h3>

## What is hetzner-k3s?

**hetzner-k3s** is a CLI tool that creates fully-configured Kubernetes clusters on [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=mqx6KKKwyook) in minutes. It uses [k3s](https://k3s.io/), a lightweight Kubernetes distribution by Rancher, and automatically configures everything you need for production workloads.

### Key Highlights

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time to create a 6-node HA cluster** | 2-3 minutes |
| **Tested scale** | 500 nodes in under 11 minutes |
| **Dependencies** | Just the CLI tool |
| **Platform fees** | None — you only pay Hetzner |

### What Gets Installed Automatically

- **k3s** — lightweight, certified Kubernetes
- **Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager** — automatic load balancer provisioning
- **Hetzner CSI Driver** — persistent volumes via Hetzner block storage
- **System Upgrade Controller** — zero-downtime k3s upgrades
- **Cluster Autoscaler** — automatic node scaling based on demand
- **Private networking and firewall** — secure cluster communication

## Getting Started

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Installation](Installation.md)** | Install hetzner-k3s on macOS, Linux, or Windows (via WSL) |
| **[Create Your First Cluster](Creating_a_cluster.md)** | Configuration reference and cluster creation |
| **[Complete Tutorial](Setting_up_a_cluster.md)** | Set up a cluster with ingress, TLS, and a sample application |
| **[Why hetzner-k3s?](Comparison_with_other_tools.md)** | Compare to managed services and Terraform-based alternatives |

## Why Choose hetzner-k3s?

### Speed Without Shortcuts

A 3-master, 3-worker highly available cluster takes just 2-3 minutes to create. This includes provisioning all infrastructure (instances, load balancer, private network, firewall) and deploying k3s with all essential components.

In stress testing, a 500-node cluster (3 masters, 497 workers) was created in under 11 minutes.

### Simplicity That Scales

- **No Terraform or Packer** — a single CLI tool handles everything
- **No management cluster** — unlike Cluster API or Claudie, you don't need Kubernetes to create Kubernetes
- **Simple YAML configuration** — human-readable and version-controllable
- **Idempotent operations** — run `create` multiple times safely; it picks up where it left off

### Complete Control

- **Your credentials stay local** — the Hetzner API token never leaves your machine
- **No third-party access** — unlike managed services, no external party can access your clusters
- **Open source (MIT License)** — inspect, modify, and contribute to the code
- **No recurring fees** — you only pay Hetzner for infrastructure

### Production-Ready Defaults

- **High availability** — distribute masters and workers across locations
- **Autoscaling** — scale worker pools based on resource demands
- **Private networking** — cluster traffic stays off the public internet
- **Automatic upgrades** — the System Upgrade Controller handles rolling updates
