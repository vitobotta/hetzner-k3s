# The easiest and fastest way to create production grade Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner Cloud



## What is this?

This is a CLI tool to super quickly and super easily create and manage Kubernetes clusters in [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) using the lightweight Kubernetes distribution [k3s](https://k3s.io/) from [Rancher](https://rancher.com/). In a recent test I created a 200 node HA cluster (3 masters, 197 worker nodes) in just **under 4 minutes** (when using only public network since private networks are limited to 100 instances per network). I believe this is a world record :)

Hetzner Cloud is an awesome cloud provider which offers a truly great service with the best performance/cost ratio in the market and locations in both Europe and USA.

k3s is my favorite Kubernetes distribution because it uses much less memory and CPU, leaving more resources to workloads. It is also super quick to deploy and upgrade because it's a single binary.

Using `hetzner-k3s`, creating a highly available k3s cluster with 3 masters for the control plane and 3 worker nodes takes **2-3 minutes** only. This includes

- creating all the infrastructure resources (instances, private network, firewall)
- deploying k3s to the nodes
- installing the [Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager) to provision load balancers right away
- installing the [Hetzner CSI Driver](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver) to provision persistent volumes using Hetzner's block storage
- installing the [Rancher System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) to make upgrades to a newer version of k3s easy and quick
- installing the [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler) to allow for autoscaling node pools

Also see this [documentation page](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s/blob/main/docs/Setting%20up%20a%20cluster.md) for a tutorial on how to set up a cluster with the most common setup to get you started.
