## Why hetzner-k3s?

**hetzner-k3s** is a CLI tool that creates production-ready Kubernetes clusters on [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=mqx6KKKwyook) in minutes, not hours. No Terraform to learn, no management cluster required, no third-party access to your credentials.

### Speed That Sets Records

- **3-node HA cluster in 2-3 minutes** — masters, workers, networking, and essential components all configured
- **500-node cluster in under 11 minutes** — tested with 3 masters and 497 workers (possibly a world record!)

### Simplicity Without Compromise

- **Single CLI tool** — no Terraform, Packer, Ansible, or existing Kubernetes cluster required
- **One YAML config file** — human-readable configuration, version-controllable
- **Batteries included** — Cloud Controller Manager, CSI driver, System Upgrade Controller, and Cluster Autoscaler installed automatically

### Complete Control, Zero Lock-in

- **Your credentials stay local** — Hetzner API token never leaves your machine
- **No third-party access** — unlike managed services, no one else can see your clusters or workloads
- **Open source (MIT License)** — inspect, modify, and contribute to the code
- **No recurring platform fees** — you only pay Hetzner for infrastructure

### How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagram.svg" alt="How hetzner-k3s works" width="700">
</p>

No Terraform. No Packer. No Ansible. No management cluster. No third-party account. Your API token never leaves your machine.

## Why Hetzner Cloud + k3s?

### Hetzner Cloud: Exceptional Value

[Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=mqx6KKKwyook) offers the best performance-to-cost ratio in the industry:

- **Up to 80% lower costs** than AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure
- **Transparent pricing** — traffic, IPv4/IPv6, DDoS protection, and firewalls included
- **Global presence** — data centers in Germany (Nuremberg, Falkenstein), Finland (Helsinki), USA (Ashburn, Hillsboro), and Singapore
- **Flexible instance types** — x86 and ARM architectures, including cost-effective ARM instances (CAX) for budget-friendly clusters
- **Proven reliability** — trusted by companies worldwide for over 25 years

### k3s: Lightweight Kubernetes

[k3s](https://k3s.io/) by Rancher is a certified Kubernetes distribution optimized for resource efficiency:

- **Lower resource footprint** — uses less memory and CPU, leaving more for your workloads
- **Single binary** — fast to deploy and upgrade
- **Production-ready** — 99.8% successful automated updates in community benchmarks

### Sample Monthly Costs

Real infrastructure costs for common cluster configurations (December 2025 pricing):

| Cluster Type | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Development** | 1 master (CX23), 2 workers (CX23) | ~€16/month |
| **Small Production** | 3 masters (CPX22), 3 workers (CPX32) | ~€58/month |
| **Medium Production** | 3 masters (CPX22), 10 workers (CPX32) | ~€135/month |
| **Large Production** | 3 masters (CPX42), 50 workers (CPX32) | ~€615/month |

*Includes load balancer (~€5.50/month). No management fees, no per-user fees—just infrastructure.*

**Compare to managed alternatives:**
- Equivalent AWS EKS: 3-5x higher infrastructure cost + $0.10/hour cluster fee (~$73/month)
- Managed Hetzner services (e.g. Cloudfleet): Infrastructure + platform fees that scale with cluster size and add up quickly

## What Gets Installed

When you run `hetzner-k3s create`, you get a complete, production-ready cluster:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **k3s** | Lightweight Kubernetes distribution |
| **[Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager)** | Automatic load balancer provisioning |
| **[Hetzner CSI Driver](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver)** | Persistent volumes via Hetzner block storage |
| **[System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller)** | Zero-downtime k3s upgrades |
| **[Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler)** | Automatic node scaling based on demand |

All integrated with Hetzner's private networking and firewall. Traefik, ServiceLB, and metrics-server are available as optional add-ons.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install hetzner-k3s

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew install vitobotta/tap/hetzner_k3s
```

**Linux binary (amd64):**
```bash
wget https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s/releases/download/v2.4.4/hetzner-k3s-linux-amd64
chmod +x hetzner-k3s-linux-amd64
sudo mv hetzner-k3s-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/hetzner-k3s
```

See [Installation Guide](https://vitobotta.github.io/hetzner-k3s/Installation/) for all platforms.

### 2. Create a Configuration File

Create `cluster.yaml`:

```yaml
hetzner_token: <your-token>
cluster_name: my-cluster
kubeconfig_path: "./kubeconfig"
k3s_version: v1.32.0+k3s1

networking:
  ssh:
    port: 22
    use_agent: false
    public_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
    private_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
  allowed_networks:
    ssh:
      - 0.0.0.0/0
    api:
      - 0.0.0.0/0

masters_pool:
  instance_type: cpx22
  instance_count: 3
  locations:
    - fsn1
    - hel1
    - nbg1

worker_node_pools:
- name: workers
  instance_type: cpx32
  instance_count: 3
  location: hel1
```

See [Creating a Cluster](https://vitobotta.github.io/hetzner-k3s/Creating_a_cluster/) for a complete configuration example with all available options.

### 3. Create Your Cluster

```bash
hetzner-k3s create --config cluster.yaml
```

In 2-3 minutes, your cluster is ready. The kubeconfig is saved automatically.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes
```

## How It Compares

| Factor | hetzner-k3s | Managed Services | Terraform-based |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Setup time** | 2-3 minutes | 5-10 minutes | 15-30+ minutes |
| **Dependencies** | CLI tool only | Third-party account* | Terraform, Packer, HCL knowledge |
| **Data privacy** | Full control | Third-party access | Full control |
| **Monthly cost** | Infrastructure only | Infrastructure + platform fees | Infrastructure only |
| **Credential exposure** | None | API tokens to third party | None |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Low | Medium-High |

*Managed services (Cloudfleet, Edka, etc.) require signing up for their platform in addition to Hetzner Cloud.

## Key Features

### High Availability
Deploy masters and worker pools across multiple locations for regional resilience.

### Autoscaling
Define min/max instances per node pool. The Cluster Autoscaler handles the rest.

```yaml
worker_node_pools:
- name: autoscaled
  instance_type: cpx32
  location: fsn1
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    min_instances: 1
    max_instances: 10
```

### Multiple Node Pools
Mix instance types and locations for different workloads. Hetzner offers x86 and ARM instances at various performance levels—including cost-effective ARM instances (CAX) ideal for budget-friendly clusters.

### Private Networking
Cluster communication over Hetzner's private network by default.

### CNI Options
Choose Flannel (simple) or Cilium (advanced networking features).

### Large Cluster Support
Tested with 500 nodes and designed to scale beyond. Clusters over 100 nodes require some configuration changes (see [Recommendations](https://vitobotta.github.io/hetzner-k3s/Recommendations/)).
